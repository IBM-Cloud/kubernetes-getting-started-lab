# Run the application locally

1. Run the container.
   ```sh
   ibmcloud dev run
   ```
   This uses your local Docker engine to run the docker image that you built in the previous step.
2. After your container starts, go to http://localhost:9080/ in your browser to see your application!
3. Use Ctrl-C to quit when you're done.
